         Pong Game
_____________________________

Pong was the first commercially successful video game.
Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. 
Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth.
The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it horizontally across the up or down side of the screen against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. 

The goal is for each player to reach eleven points before the opponent; points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other.
